<h1>Game of thrones: IT departments and the cloud</h1>
<p>
    Cloud computing, a buzzword in the tech and business worlds, became popular through the big leaders – Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Apple and Salesforce.com. It’s mostly associated with Apple’s iCloud, yet not easily defined. Technically, it represents a shared pool of computing resources, including networks, servers, applications, and services, that can be provisioned with minimal management effort.

    ‘The climb’
</h2>
<p>
    Cloud computing exists under numerous categories. The most popular are software-as-a-service (SaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). SaaS is the most common, and can be used by both individuals and enterprises. The former might use Microsoft Office 365, Dropbox and Google Apps, the latter Salesforce.com, Amazon Web Services, Zendesk and Slack. For companies, these types of services can allow a remote workforce to be supported more easily and operate more independently.

<h2>
    ‘The wars to come’
</h2>
<p>
    Despite their advantages, cloud services are not yet widely adopted because of a range of threats. These can include security risks, including data confidentiality, insider and outsider attacks, and data loss. Every individual and enterprise highly values their data, making the need for protection paramount. With the cloud, however, data location is unknown for users and clients, and can lead to compliance issues. The data stored in public cloud environments must abide by national and international laws, yet its “location” is unclear.
